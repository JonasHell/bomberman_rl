# Our Bomberman Agent

This is the setup for a project/competition amongst students to train a machine learning agent for the game Bomberman.
Since we particpated in this challenge this repository also contains the code for our agent.

The branch DQFD contains an implementation of deep Q learning from demonstrations as suggested here https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03732. 
In addition, it allows for generating new expert demonstration data during training similar to the epsilon greedy exploration strategy.
